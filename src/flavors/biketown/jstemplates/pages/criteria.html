<h1>Station Planning FAQ</h1>

<h3>What makes a great bike share station location?</h3>

<p>The best locations for bike share are highly visible, located near public transit and/or major destinations where large numbers of Portlanders live, work and recreate.</p>

<h3>How did PBOT determine the service and draft station locations?</h3>

<p>PBOT developed the service area and the 300 station candidates by predicting demand based on land use, transportation, and equity factors. These criteria include population, residential, commercial, affordable housing, and employment density; existing bicycle facilities, transit infrastructure, and key destinations.</p>

<p>From these demand factors PBOT developed a heat map showing areas with high demand for bike share.  Read the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/70288">full analysis here</a>.</p>

<h3>Why isn’t more of Portland in the service area?</h3>
<p>Thanks to Nike’s partnership, PBOT has already increased the system size by 66% and expanded BIKETOWN to more neighborhoods. PBOT hopes to grow BIKETOWN’s size further in the future.</p>
<p>Portland has learned from over 60 US bike share cities that systems are most successful when the service area builds outward from city’s high density core. As important, in much the same way as other successful transit modes are planned with dense, regular station stops, bike share systems with stations located closer together tend to have much higher ridership rates. A system with stations too far apart usually has lower ridership rates which doesn’t meet the system’s goals.</p>

<h3>How big are the stations?</h3>
<p>The average BIKETOWN station will be 20 racks, which is 53’ in length and 6’ in width. The racks can be separated to get around street trees, benches, etc.</p>
<h3>Can you tell me more on how PBOT determined the 300 draft locations?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pdxbikeshare.com">BIKETOWN project page</a> has detailed analysis on the station planning and siting process.
In addition to convenience and utility, safety is a top priority in selecting a site. Stations are not located where they will be impeding traffic, such as in busy intersections or turning lanes.</p>
<p>Stations are placed to be convenient to landmarks, popular destinations, or affordable housing. Where possible, locations are co-located with public transit options like rail or buses, either providing a link to mass transit options for connectivity or located in places that are not well served by public transit. These placements allow bike share to ease the first and last mile connection for people riding public transit.</p>
<p>Preference is given to streets that are flatter, closer to bike lanes, in low traffic areas, and lack physical barriers like stairs. Additional preference is given to sites that minimize displacement of parking spaces.</p>
<p>Locations are also selected to maximize equipment performance. Since the bikes and station kiosks are solar powered, stations sites are also selected and oriented to avoid overhead obstructions and maximize exposure to the sun.</p>
<p>All of these factors are consolidated into a scoring rubric to score each individual station location. PBOT is showing the best 300+ candidates which will be narrowed down to the final 100 through the public participation process and additional technical analysis.</p>
