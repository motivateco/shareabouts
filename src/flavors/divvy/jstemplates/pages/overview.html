<p>Divvy is Chicagoland's bike share system, with thousands of bikes available at more than 580 stations across Chicago, Evanston, and Oak Park. Since launching in 2013, Divvy has undergone two major expansions, resulting in a service area of more than 100 square miles. This makes Divvy the largest bike share system based on service area in North America.</p>
<p>As Divvy continues to grow and expand, we'll need your help. Because you know your community best, we've launched this page so that you can offer suggestions for new station locations and provide comments on existing ones.</p>
<p>On this map, you'll see:</p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold;margin:0 0 0.5em 33px;padding-left:0;list-style:none;">
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-station-existing.png" style="height:35px;width:auto;float:left;margin-left:-33px;"> Current Stations</li>
  <li class="clearfix"><img src="/static/css/images/marker-comment-new.png" style="margin-right:3px;float:left;margin-left:-31px;"> Suggested Stations by the Public</li>
</ul>
<p>All input will be considered by the Divvy Siting Team when planning future system expansions.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share this page (<a href="http://suggest.divvybikes.com">suggest.divvybikes.com</a>) with your friends, family, and community for their feedback.</p>
